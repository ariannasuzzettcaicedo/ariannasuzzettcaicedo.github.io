    <h1>For Jaiden 💖</h1>
    <p>I had no idea that 365 days ago I was going to meet someone who would become so important to me. The time we’ve spent talking over all these months has been the best months I’ve had.</p>
    <p>I can’t stop thinking about the first time we finally see each other and hug. That day will be the best day of our story, and I know the wait will be completely worth it.</p>
    <p>All the calls, the messages, the games, and the laughter are things I value so deeply and wish I could repeat millions of times. I want us to keep talking until we’re old, and to see your eyes every morning when I wake up.</p>
    <p>This year I’ve learned many things, and the most important one has been learning to be patient and to want you in your love language.</p>
    <p>I want you for who you are, for your intelligence, your kindness, your sweetness, your advice, and the way you drive me crazy without even trying. With you, I’m very sensitive and I feel things I don’t feel with anyone else. You make my days so much happier, and I want it to stay that way for a very long time.</p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing me every day, even from far away.</p>
    <p><strong>Happy first year of this beautiful friendship and love.</strong></p>
